# Jarvis Desktop Voice Assistant🔥



**Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own assistant? Imagine how easier it would be doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command, opening different browsers in just a voice command.**

**This project is simple desktop voice assistant built with python named as “Jarvis Desktop Voice Assistant”. This project is fully completed and error free. It was compiled in VS Code Editor.**

**🔸 Let's be honest, it's not as intelligent as in the movie, but it can do a lot of cool things and automate your daily tasks you do on your personal computers/laptops.**

2. **Clone The Repository**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <URL>
     cd Jarvis-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
     ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
     - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - This activates the virtual environment and should look like `(venv) directory/of/your/project>`

4. **Install Requirements**

   - Install all the requirements given in **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/kishanrajput23/Jarvis-Desktop-Voice-Assistant/blob/main/requirements.txt)** by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 📌Learning Resources to Extend This Project

To build this project further and enhance its capabilities, a strong understanding of the following areas is recommended:

### 🐍 Python Fundamentals
Python is the core language behind this project. A solid grasp of syntax, control flow, functions, and error handling will help you modify and extend the assistant’s functionality.  
👉 [Python Programming Course](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/premium/master-python-programming)

### 🎙️ Voice Processing & NLP
Voice commands are processed using speech and text-based techniques. Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts such as tokenization and text analysis can help improve voice interaction.  
👉 [Introduction to NLP](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/learn-for-free/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing)

### 🤖 Intelligence & Generative AI
Currently, the assistant follows predefined logic. By integrating Generative AI concepts, it can be enhanced into a conversational assistant capable of generating intelligent responses and performing web-based tasks.  
👉 [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/premium/master-generative-ai)

### 👁️ Computer Vision
To make the assistant more advanced, computer vision can be introduced for features like face detection and gesture control. Learning image and video processing fundamentals is a good starting point.
